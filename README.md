HackTheRack - RoundUp

Welcome to the GitHub Repository of the Hack The Rack group "RoundUp".

We are doing Challenge 1.

Instead of just using static customer segmentation, we suggest that a sustainable CRM model should be dynamic in nature, pinpointing the needs of the customers at the right time and right place with a poisson regression model (found in: https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Poisson-Regression-Roundup).

Using location tags and external data (such as facebook event), we can identify which event our customers will be attending. With this information, we can provide suggestions and promotions that is suitable for them. For example, using the customer's location and API from HK Observatory, we will be able to notify our customers to bring umbrellas or they can rent/ purchase one at our stores.

We can also analyze past transaction records and suggest targeted promotions to people, for example those who are going to concerts in Hung Hom can be notified of a beer promotion. By satisfying the timely needs of our customers, not only this will increase their spending and loyalty to us (Circle K), we will also be able to provide precision marketing campaigns to our suppliers.

In the future, we can expand to tracking the health data of the customers if we are provided with the necessary identification methods. The external data for health information can be retrieved from the Fitbit database or from Apple Health.

An interesting aspect of this repository is that this ecosystem of using dynamic segmentation can also be used in other retailing businesses such as Trinity and Toys R' Us.
